    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language <br>
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages <br>
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page <br>
        HTML consists of a series of elements <br>
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content <br>
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The !DOCTYPE html tag declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document <br>
        The html tag element is the root element of an HTML page <br>
        The head tag element contains meta information about the HTML page <br>
        The title tag element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the
        page's tab) <br>
        The body tag element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as
        headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. <br>
        The h1 tag element defines a large heading <br>
        The p tag element defines a paragraph <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        What is an HTML Element?
    </p>
    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

    tagname Content goes here... /tagname
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

    h1 My First Heading /h1
    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Note: </span> Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element).
        These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
        Web Browsers :

        The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them
        correctly.

        A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

        Note: The content inside the body section (the white area above) will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the title element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
