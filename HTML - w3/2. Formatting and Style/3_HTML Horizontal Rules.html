    <h1>HTML Horizontal Rules</h1>
    <p>
        The 'hr' tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        <br>
        The 'hr' element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
        <br>
        The hr element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book.
        <br>
        The hr tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
