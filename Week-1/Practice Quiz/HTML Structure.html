Download and install VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Open it up and open a new folder from within it. Create an HTML page with the basic HTML structure. Put some content within the body (say for example “Hello HTML”). Copy the path to the file on your system and open a modern web browser like Chrome and open the page within it (by pasting the URL in the address bar and fetching it). -->
