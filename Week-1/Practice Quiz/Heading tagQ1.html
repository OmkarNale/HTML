<!-- The heading levels should follow the importance of the text they enclose. Since section titles are enclosed in h2, you must strive to use h3 for titles of the sub-sections. The best way then is to use CSS to modify the font size for the elements that enclose titles of sub-sections (you can (for example) target h3 elements that enclose titles of sub-sections by adding a common class to each of them, and adding styles for the class) -->

    <h1>Q No: 1</h1>

    <p>
        You are creating an eBook published as a web site. Every chapter appears on a separate web page. A chapter has
        sections within, and sections have sub-sections. You have used h1 for the chapter title and h2 for the section
        title. However you notice that using h3 for the sub-section title provides a font size that is large for your
        taste â€“ you want a smaller font size. What would you do?
        a)Try our h4, h5, or h6 instead of h3 for titles of the sub-sections
        b)Use CSS to adjust font size for the titles of the sub-sections
