        RRR[a] is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the
        film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T.
        Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and
        Olivia Morris. It centers around two real-life Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram
        Bheem (Rama Rao), their friendship and their fight against the British Raj. Set in the 1920s, the film tells an
        alternate history story exploring the undocumented period in their lives, when both the revolutionaries chose to
        go into obscurity before they began the fight for their country.
        <br />
        Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between
        them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was formally announced in
        March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August
        2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few
        sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M.
        Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's
        production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.
        <br />
        Made on a budget of ₹550 crore ($72 million), RRR is the most expensive Indian film to date. The film was
        initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which was postponed multiple times due to production
        delays and the COVID pandemic. RRR was released theatrically on 25 March 2022. With ₹240 crore (US$30 million)
        worldwide on its first day, RRR recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film. It emerged as the
        highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ₹415 crore (US$52
        million).[6] The film grossed ₹1,200–1,258 crore worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian
        film, including the third highest-grossing Indian film and second highest-grossing Telugu film worldwide.[4][7]
        <br />
        RRR received universal acclaim for Rajamouli's direction, writing, performances (particularly Rama Rao and
        Charan), soundtrack, action sequences, cinematography, editing, and visual effects. Among other accolades, RRR
        became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including
        Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for "Naatu Naatu", making it the first Asian nomination
        to win the award.[8][9] The song is also competing to win the Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards.[10]
        It has also won the Best Foreign Language Film and the Best Song award at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards. The
        film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review.[11]

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        In 1920, during the British Raj, administrator Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad,
        where they abduct Malli, a young girl with a talent for artistry, from the Gond tribe. Enraged by the act, the
        tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem, embarks to Delhi with the intent of rescuing her, under the guise of a Muslim
        man named Akhtar. Elsewhere, the Nizamate of Hyderabad, sympathetic to the Raj, warns Scott's office of the
        impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists the assistance of A. Rama Raju, an ambitious officer in the
        Indian Imperial Police to quell the threat. Embarking on his new assignment, Raju and his uncle, Venkateswarulu,
        attend several pro-independence gatherings in the hopes of finding clues. His opinions attract the attention of
        Lachhu, Bheem's gullible aide.

        Falling for Raju's trickery, he attempts to induct him into Bheem's plot, only to flee when he discovers his
        true identity. A short while later, both Bheem and Raju encounter each other; unaware of their opposing
        identities and intentions, they unite to save a boy from a train wreck, sparking a friendship between the two.
        Over time, the two grow close to each other. Raju subsequently assists Bheem in courting Jenny, Scott's niece,
        unaware of his intention to infiltrate Scott's residence. When Jenny takes Bheem to her residence, Bheem locates
        the room where Malli is being held in captivity; he meets Malli and promises Malli that he will free her.
        Meanwhile, Raju deduces Lachhu's covert identity and whereabouts; he subsequently apprehends him. While
        interrogating him, Lachhu goads a banded krait into attacking Raju; he thereafter warns him of his imminent fate
        and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds.
        <br />
        Dazed, Raju approaches Bheem, who immediately tends to him. Noticing similar religious features between Lachhu
        and Bheem, Raju deduces his true intentions. Regardless, Bheem divulges his tribal identity and his mission,
        still unaware of Raju's covert identity. At an event held in Scott's honor, Bheem's men barge into his residence
        with a lorry filled with wild animals, which creates havoc among the assembled guests. The animals maul Scott's
        guards, allowing Bheem to briefly fight; however, Raju arrives and subsequently discloses to him of Scott's
        intention to kill Malli; he surrenders out of obligation. In the aftermath of the incident, Raju is promoted for
        thwarting Bheem, yet, he is absorbed with guilt over his own actions, recalling his own pro-nationalistic
        background and his actual alter-ego as a mole within the police; he was seeking a promotion in order to gain
        access to shipments of guns to smuggle to his village.
        <br />
        At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him into recanting his actions; the former chooses to be
        flogged instead. Resisting his injuries, Bheem sings in defiance, which incites an assembled crowd into
        rebelling. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally realizes the recklessness of his actions. Determined to
        save his friend, he persuades Scott to secretly execute Bheem whilst preparing an ambush to save him;
        nevertheless, Scott deduces his plot. Whilst managing to rescue Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously
        injured. Bheem, who had simultaneously managed to free himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an
        attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him before escaping with her. Months later, Bheem, who had escaped with
        Malli to Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities; he narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita, Raju's
        fiancée, repels them by claiming of a smallpox epidemic as a pretext.
        <br />
        Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's actual, anti-colonial objectives and of his impending execution.
        Crestfallen upon realizing his own folly, Bheem vows to save him. With the assistance of a sympathetic Jenny,
        Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him, alerting multiple soldiers in the process.
        Defeating them, the pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate more soldiers with the use of a longbow
        taken from a Ram shrine. Taking the fight to Scott, the pair hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks'
        magazines, which consequently ignites. The subsequent explosion kills many within Scott's company, including
        Catherine. Having finally cornered a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with an English rifle, fulfilling
        their respective objectives. They subsequently steal a cache of Scott's weaponry, later reuniting with Sita and
        Jenny.
        <br />
        In honour of completing their respective missions, Raju asks Bheem to let him grant a wish for him, to which,
        Bheem asks Raju to provide education to him and his community.
