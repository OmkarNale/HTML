            What is an operating system ?
        </h1>
        <p>
            An <span class="imp-section">operating system (OS)</span> is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined <span class="imp-section">application program interface (API)</span>. In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through <span class="imp-section">a user interface</span>, such as a <span class="imp-section">command-line interface (CLI) </span>  or <span class="imp-section">a graphical UI (GUI)</span> .
