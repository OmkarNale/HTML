<!-- Create a web page with a form with labelled and named input elements that take
phone number
OTP (should not show up on screen while typing)
Make sure the form when submitted makes a request for the url /login.

(you may already have created this page in a previous exercise)

 

Now, make sure the OTP does not appear in the URL when the form is submitted. It should instead be part of the request body. -->
